# Image_Quality_Enhancement
This Python script enhances image quality by expanding the 2D arrays of RGB color channels in the input file, "test.jpeg." After normalizing and merging the channels, the improved image is saved as "hd_output.jpeg." Run the script with required libraries installed for a quick and effective image enhancement process.
